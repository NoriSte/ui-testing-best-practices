- [ ] await, don't sleep
    - [ ] wait for contents
        - [ ] standard
        - [ ] with custom selectors
    - [ ] wait for network requests
    - [ ] wait for front-end specific state
- [ ] back-end related tests
    - [ ] test request and response payloads
    - [ ] test the frontend with the integration tests, the backend with the E2E ones
    - [ ] test the server schema (or everything that can impact the front-end app like PostMan exports, Elastic Search mappings etc.). That sould not be part of the front-end tests but consider that the app will be often broken by a server data change
    - [ ] allow to run the integration tests only (during the development phase) or the E2E ones only (for colleagues, CI etc.)
- [ ] testing strategy
    - [ ] component vs integration vs e2e testing
    - [ ] write a lot of integration tests, make a few E2E ones (happy paths)
    - [ ] when you find a bug, write the test and then fix the bug
    - [ ] choose a reference browser (and if you need mobile browsers use TestCafè)
    - [ ] avoid perfectionism, lot of UI interaction details are useful but they don't need to be tested (unless you have been proven that they bring value to your company)
    - [ ] if you use typescript in your app, use it in your tests too, the initial temptation of avoiding it will not last long
- [ ] ui testing best practices
    - [ ] assert frequently. An assertion is auto-explicative, an error isn't.
    - [ ] choose a made on purpose library
    - [ ] use the same front-end constants/functions
    - [ ] UI testing framework as a development tool. Write tests step by step to avoid manual testing even during the development phase and to have them already written when you finished (easier with Cypress).
    - [ ] don't use the UI to reach the desired UI state. But remember to avoid writing one more app into your testing framework to consume the same resources
    - [ ] we aren't unit-testing, every test has a flow and a lot of assertions
    - [ ] deterministic tests as wrote here https://docs.cypress.io/guides/core-concepts/conditional-testing.html#Error-Recovery
- [ ] in your app / practical advices
    - [ ] expose costants/functions. It makes tests more portable too
        - [ ] don't delay this process, by definition UI tests are slow, avoid them failing for a silly string
    - [ ] expose some shortcuts. Everything useful for leting the UI run faster (without compromising reliability) is welcome
    - [ ] let the front-end work for you
- [ ] base your tests on contents
    - [ ] ui testing is framework agnostic, base it on contents (the same consumed by the user)
    - [ ] pay attention on the pages that update frequently
    - [ ] a content-based failing test needs just a screenshot to be debugged, an attribute-based one needs the page to be inspected
    - [ ] if you can't rely on contents, use test-ids, never user classes of ids
    - [ ] avoid testing implementation details
- [ ] generic testing best practices
    - [ ] use the right assertion
    - [ ] use "only" and "skip"
    - [ ] name the test wisely
    - [ ] name the test file wisely
    - [ ] check the Yoni's post https://medium.com/@me_37286/yoni-goldberg-javascript-nodejs-testing-best-practices-2b98924c9347
    - [ ] don't share the state between tests
- [ ] component testing
    - [ ] use storybook  (or a styleguide framework of choice) for components reporting all cases. In fact, they are tests too
    - [ ] add snapshot testing to storybook (or a styleguide framework of choice)
    - [ ] add regression testing to storybook (or a styleguide framework of choice)
- [ ] performance
    - [ ] always choose the "simplest"/fastest test. dom-ui-testing is faster then Puppeteer that's faster then Cypress etc.
- [ ] UI test debugging (mark every single tip necessary/unnecessary with existing frameworks)
    - [ ] make screenshots
    - [ ] launch the browser in non-headless mode
    - [ ] launch the browser with the devtools already opened
    - [ ] slow down the browser actions
    - [ ] increase the test timeout
    - [ ] avoid closing the browser when the test ends
    - [ ] console.log the name of the test
    - controlla altri trucchi sulle slide
- [ ] frameworks
    - [ ] everything is async
    - [ ] dedicated ones vs generic ones
    - [ ] device emulation
    - [ ] cross browser support
    - [ ] custom extension installation
    - [ ] test management dedicated UI
    - [ ] running tests command log
    - [ ] hidden flags etc.
    - [ ] dedicated development browser
    - [ ] available plugins
    - [ ] generic browser automations
    - [ ] automatic dynamic waiting (like the cypress one)
    - [ ] snapshot management (like the cypress one)
    - [ ] dom-testing-library integration
    - [ ] automatic screenshot/video management
    - [ ] Puppeteer only: Node.js UI, make self-contained Node.js apps with a UI (thank to Carlo by Google)
    - [ ] automatic retry (cypress)
    - [ ] browser automation
    - [ ] common issues
        - [ ] promise everything
        - [ ] puppeteer evaluate
        - [ ] cypress then
    - [ ] ... ?
- [ ] beginners
    - [ ] what is UI testing
        - [ ] why is it so important
        - [ ] headless browser
        - [ ] use it while studying
        - [ ] automate repetitive and annoying
        - [ ] use testing frameworks as development tools
        - [ ] data scraping (take care that some sites will block you because of the high number of login requests etc.)
        - [ ] avoid regression
        - [ ] avoid manually testing
    - [ ] the other kind of tests
        - [ ] unit
        - [ ] integration
        - [ ] regression
        - [ ] snap shot testing
        - [ ] the testing pyramid (standard and the kent's one)
        - [ ] Always use the simplest kind of test
    - [ ] Why it's hard to do UI testing
        - [ ] you aren’t in isolation (like in Unit tests), nor in a super-mocked environment...
        - [ ] You have a real browser on a real network
        - [ ] Simulating the (exact) user behaviour sometimes could be very tricky
        - [ ] They can fail
        - [ ] They are slow
