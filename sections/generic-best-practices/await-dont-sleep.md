# Await, don't sleep

<br/><br/>

### One Paragraph Explainer

When testing your UI, you define a sort of key points the app must pass through. Reaching these key
points is an asynchronous process because, almost 100% of the times, your UI does not update
synchronously.

Those key points are called **deterministic events**, as known as something that you know that must happen.

It depends on the events you define and how your UI reaches them but, usually, there are some
"long" waitings, like XHR requests, and some faster ones, like re-render updates.

The solution to the asynchronous updates seems handy: **sleeping/pausing the test** for a bunch of
milliseconds, tenths of a second, or even seconds. It can make your test working because it gives
the app the time to update itself and moving to the next deterministic event to be tested.

Consider that, except for specific and known waitings (like when you use `setInterval` or
`setTimeout`), **it's totally unpredictable** how much the sleeping time should be because it could depend on:
- the network state (for XHR requests)
- the total amount of available machine resources (CPU, RAM, etc.)
  - a CI pipeline can limit them for example
  - other apps can consume them on your local machine too
- the concurrence of other resource-consuming updates (canvas, etc.)
- a bunch of unpredictable game players like Service Workers, cache management etc. that can make
  the UI update process faster or slower

Every fixed delay leads your test to be more brittle and **increasing its duration**. You are going to
find a balance between false negatives—when the test fails because of a too low sleeping
time—and exaggerate test duration.

What about waiting just the right amount of time? The amount of time that makes the test as fast as
possible!

Waitings fall in four main categories
- **[page load waitings](#page-load-waitings)**: the first waiting to manage while testing your app, waiting for an event that
  allows you to understand that the page is interactive
- **[content waitings](#content-waitings)**: waiting for DOM element that matches a selector
- **[XHR request waitings](#xhr-request-waitings)**: waiting for an XHR request start or the corresponding response received
- **[custom waitings](#custom-waitings)**: waiting for everything strictly related to the app that does not fall into
  the above categories

Every UI testing tool manages waitings in different ways, sometimes automatically and
sometimes manually. Below you can find some examples
of implementing the listed waitings.


<br/><br/>

## Page load waitings

Every tool manages the page load waiting in a different way (in terms of what is waited before
considering the page loaded).

Cypress

```javascript
cy.visit('http://localhost:3000')
```

<details><summary>Puppeteer</summary>

```javascript
await page.goto("http://localhost:3000");
```
</details>

<details><summary>Selenium</summary>

```javascript
driver.get('http://localhost:3000');
driver.wait(function() {
  return driver.executeScript('return document.readyState').then(function(readyState) {
    return readyState === 'complete';
  });
});
```
</details>

<details><summary>TestCafé</summary>

```javascript
fixture `Page Load`
    .page `http://localhost:3000`;
```
</details>


<br/><br/>

## Content waitings

Take a look at the following examples to see how waiting for a DOM element could be implemented in
the available tools.

### Code Examples
Cypress

- waiting for an element:
```javascript
// it waits up to 4 seconds by default
cy.get("#form-feedback")
// the timeout can be customized
cy.get("#form-feedback", {timeout: 5000})
```
- waiting for an element with specific content
```javascript
cy.get("#form-feedback").contains("Success")
```

<details><summary>Puppeteer</summary>

- waiting for an element:
```javascript
// it waits up to 30 seconds by default
await page.waitForSelector('#form-feedback');
// the timeout can be customized
await page.waitForSelector('#form-feedback', {timeout: 5000});
```
- waiting for an element with specific content
```javascript
await page.waitForFunction(selector => {
  const el = document.querySelector(selector);
  return el && el.innerText === "Success";
}, {}, '#form-feedback');
```

</details>

<details><summary>Selenium</summary>

- waiting for an element:
```javascript
driver.wait(until.elementLocated(By.id('#form-feedback')), 4000);
```
- waiting for an element with specific content
```javascript
const el = driver.wait(until.elementLocated(By.id('#form-feedback')), 4000);
wait.until(ExpectedConditions.textToBePresentInElement(el, "Success"));
```
</details>

<details><summary>TestCafé</summary>

- waiting for an element:
```javascript
// it waits up to 10 seconds by default
await Selector('#form-feedback')
// the timeout can be customized
await Selector('#form-feedback').with({timeout: 4000})
```
- waiting for an element with specific content
```javascript
await Selector('#form-feedback').withText('Success')
```
</details>

<details><summary>DOM Testing Library<sup> <a href="#footnote1">1</a></sup></summary>

- waiting for an element:
```javascript
await waitForElement(() => getByTestId('form-feedback'));
```
- waiting for an element with specific content
```javascript
const container = await waitForElement(() => getByTestId('form-feedback'));
await waitForElement(() => getByText('Success'), { container });
```
</details>

<br/><br/>

## XHR request waitings

### Code Examples

Cypress

- waiting for an XHR request/response
```javascript
cy.server()
cy.route("http://dummy.restapiexample.com/api/v1/employees").as('employees')
cy.wait("@employees")
  .then(xhr => xhr.response.body)
  .then(body => {/* ... */})
```


<details><summary>Puppeteer</summary>

- waiting for an XHR request
```javascript
await page.waitForRequest('http://dummy.restapiexample.com/api/v1/employees');
```
- waiting for an XHR response
```javascript
const response = await page.waitForResponse('http://dummy.restapiexample.com/api/v1/employees');
const body = response.json();
```
</details>

<br />
Even if it's a really important point, at the time of writing (May, 2019) it seems that waiting for XHR requests and responses is not so
common. With exceptions for Cypress and Puppeteer, other tools/frameworks force you to look for
something in the DOM that reflects the XHR result instead of looking for the XHR request itself. You can read more about th topic:

- DOM Testing Library: [await API](https://testing-library.com/docs/dom-testing-library/api-async#wait)

<br /><br />

## Custom waitings

The various UI testing tools/frameworks have built-in solutions to perform a lot of checks, but let's
concentrate on writing a custom waiting. Since UI testing is 100% asynchronous, a custom waiting
should face recursive promises, a concept not so handy to manage at the beginning.

Luckily, there are some handy solutions and plugins to help us with that. Consider if we want to
wait until a global variable (`foo`) is assigned with a particular value (`bar`): below you are going to
find some examples.

### Code Examples

Cypress

Thanks to the [cypress-wait-until plugin](https://github.com/NoriSte/cypress-wait-until) you can do:
```javascript
cy.waitUntil(() => cy.window().then(win => win.foo === "bar"))
```


<details><summary>Puppeteer</summary>

```javascript
await page.waitForFunction('window.foo === "bar"');
```
</details>

<details><summary>Selenium</summary>

```javascript
browser.executeAsyncScript(`
  window.setTimeout(function(){
    if(window.foo === "bar") {
      arguments[arguments.length - 1]();
    }
  }, 300);
`);
```
</details>

<details><summary>TestCafé</summary>

```javascript
const waiting = ClientFunction(() => window.foo === 'bar')
await t.expect(waiting()).ok({ timeout: 5000 })
```
</details>

<details><summary>DOM Testing Library<sup> <a href="#footnote1">1</a></sup></summary>

```javascript
await wait(() => global.foo === "bar");
```
</details>


<br />
<a id="footnote1">1</a>: unlike Cypress, Puppeteer, etc. DOM Testing Library is quite a different tool, that's why the examples are not available for every single part.
